    Now more than ever, a space is needed where those whose survival and rights are under threat can come together across divisions to protect one another and build the movement for a more caring world.
    </p>
    <p>
    The new Crossroads Women’s Center in Philadelphia has the potential to be a resource for such efforts, locally, nationally, and internationally.
    </p>
    <p>
    In Los Angeles, Philadelphia, and San Francisco, and with our sister women’s centre in London, we pooled our resources for over 18 years and, with careful saving, were able to get a new building. We are now putting huge efforts into gathering pro bono professional advice and fundraising to develop it into a welcoming, accessible, environmentally and community friendly space.
    </p>
    <p>
    But all the goodwill and volunteer effort will not pay for everything. <b>We need your financial help for repairs and renovations estimated at $200,000.</b>
